2008-10-07  radu corlan  <rcorlan@visionresearch.com>

	* attempted a fix for a 64-bit pointer problem in psf_new; pending
	testing by brian.

0.9.12

	spotting the error).

	[ riccardo ]
	fixed a typo in help -> about (waranty/warranty)
	forced the x11 terminal in gnuplot calls (instead the default one)
	corrected "-" with "\-" in gcx.1, "-" is an hyphen (not minus) for groff

	read support for 32-bit files.

0.9.9
	increased number of iterations for wcs fit to handle high-dec
	  plates.

0.9.6
	Added CD_ and PC_ wcs keyword support on read;
	Fixed yet another wcs convergence issue.

0.9.5
        Added a new special recipe name: _AUTO_; it will attempt to load a
	  rcp by object name, and if that is not found, create a tycho
	  one.
	When images are updated in the image window, the cuts are updated
	  based on the respective averages, in order to keep the
	  background at roughly the same level.
	Added a "sumner" import function that reates a recipe from a
	  Sumner .seq file.
	Fixed a sign error in adjust_wcs (wcs.c) which caused the wcs
	  fit to diverge on certain field orientations.


0.9.4
	Added special recipy names:
	   _TYCHO_ will create a tycho recipy for the given frame, taking
	     the object name from either the "-j" option or the "object"
	     field in the fits header.
	   _OBJECT_ will look for a file called <object name>.rcp
	     in the recipy file path; the object name is taken from the
	     fits header, or can be specified with the "-j" option.
	Fixed a segfault occuring when attempting to read tycho fields
	   that straddle the RA=0 meridian.
	Fixed a segfault occuring when creating tycho recipes with invalid
	   object names.
	Added the option to select a recipe file (or _TYCHO_ or
	   _OBJECT_) in the ccd reduction dialog.
	Saturated stars are no longer detected as field stars (and used as
	   alignment stars or for wcs fitting).

0.9.3
	Fixed an error in detecting declination reversals (the situation
	when the mount is commanded to move north, but it actually moves
	south, which is a Gemini "feature");

0.9.2
	An emergency release containing the file "scope.h" that has been
	left out of 0.9.1 tarball. Thanks to Jean-Pierre Goffaux for
	letting me know.

0.9.1
	Revamped telescope control code for smoother operation.

	Unified LX200 and Losmandy operations.

	Fixed serial flush on telescope control.

	An attempt is made to set the centering and guiding speeds to the
	  value set in options. Setting is done in the Gemini level 3
	  format.

	The slew rate is forced to 2 degrees per second before initiating
	  a slew. to chenge this, see the define at the top of tele.c.

	Added an option for negative display.

	Replaced the rather annoying colored popup status window with
	  a change in the obslist background according to script status.

0.8.9
	Separated projection from plate solution.

	Multiple plate solution forms supported.

	Plate transforms moved to plate.c

	A temporary check for closure of wcs transformations is performed
	  on each cats_xypix.

	Loading a rcp file will update an initial wcs if the wcs was not
	  obtained from an image header (but "inherited" from another
	  image).

	Added a "wcs invalidate" option in the wcs menu.

	Set the "r" shortcut for load recipe.

	Added the "match existing stars" option in the wcs menu, that will
	  detect stars and match against the currently loaded field stars.

	Added the option to download stars from the CDS (by calling the
	  visquery program) directly into a frame. So far GSC-ACT, UCAC2, GSC2 and
	  USNO-B are supported for on-line download. See README.vizquery
	  for more details.

	Created a new top-level menu entry (catalogs). Moved the field star
	  load options there.

0.8.8
	Selected frames in the multiframe reduction dialog can be hidden;
	  hidden frames will not be used for any processing, saved, or plotted.

	Fixed an error in the value reported for "error" by the star
	  measure function.

	Merged wcs changing buttons contributted by Pertti Paakkonen.

0.8.7
	Experimental support for 32-bit float frames (BITPIX=-32) added.

	Stacking now calculates an equivalent time and exptime, as
	follows:

	   * first, the center of each exposure (DATE_OBS-EXPTIME/2) is
	     calculated;
	   * the weighted mean of all exposure centers is used for the
	     central time of the equivalent exposure;
	   * the sum of the individual exposure times is used for the
	     equivalent exptime;
	   * the time of the output frame is set at equivalent center
	     minus 1/2 of the equivalent exptime.

	When frame times are extracted in the photometry reports, the
	center of the exposure is used (rather than just the time from the
	fits header).

0.8.6
	Improved sky estimation in sky search, so now some cases where
	stars weren't detected are fixed.

	Added an option to update coordinates of aphot targets after
	centering - useful for following asteroids for instance. Only star
	that have the "astrometric" flag cleared will be moved. When the
	move option is set, stars that have the 'astromet' flag cleared
	are no longer used in wcs fitting.

	Fixed an error in the replacement strndup function (which was
	introduced in 0.7.5 and affectes mostly camera control ops).

	Reorganised the ccd reduction dialog; added a command to reduce a
	single frame.

	Added a "move star" option in the star pop-up menu for changing
	the positions of catalog stars to match detected stars. Select a
	detected star, then right click on a catalog star and select "move
	star" to move it.

	Added an "aphot to multiframe" command in the
	processing menu.

	Fixed -o for photometry.

	Removed all inlines (that seem to cause trouble).

0.8.5
	Fixed some typos, added some tooltips.

	Star mag vs time plots std+residual instead of residual.

	Calculate and display star stats in the star mag vs residual plot.

	Added photometry option to the ccd reduce dialog - for timeseries.

0.8.4
	Region-growing spurious star ellimination in sky estimation.

	Plot the sky histogram.

	Deprecated the mean-median method.

	Included basename and dirname for cygwin compilation, added a
	define for HUGE. The program now runs (quite slowly) on cygwin (in X mode).

	Changed some static inlines that behave strangely in some gcc
	version (most notably the version that comes with fedora core3).

0.8.3
	Accept even a single comp star when reducing frames (differential
	mode).

	If a single comp star is found, the aavso report will add the
	"diff" comment and list the comp star.

	Calculate and report differential airmass for stars.

	Report sky for each star.

0.8.2
	Include outliers in me1 calculation (resulting in larger me1
	  figures for frames that have either many or low error outliers).
	Plot radial profiles and encircled flux for stars. Report fitted FWHM.
	Improved synthetic mean histogram clipping behaviour with
	  degenerate histograms.
	Corrected a small error in calculating sky contribution.
	Moved the zoom/cut status to the top-right and expanded the status
	  bar.
	Quick star measure from the star pop-up menu.
	Plot to file is now a global option.
	Changed the status bar so that all messages display until being
	  replaced by new ones.

0.8.1
	Create synthetic stars with Gaussian or Moffat profiles.
	Show more info in the star edit dialog.
	Make sure the errors are positive in the henden import.
	Fixed an error in magnitude calculation (of the order of 0.005).

0.7.8
	Changed "recipy" to "recipe" in many places.
	Fixed a segfault when loading a fits header with an "object" field
	  that consists of blanks.

0.7.7
	Clamp the extracted star width in centroiding error calculations to
	  avoid underestimated errors for faint stars. Fixed an error in
	  position error SNR scaling.

0.7.6
	Plot of position errors after star centering.
	If we have enough position reference stars with defined errors,
	  other stars are ignored in the wcs fit.

0.7.5
	Fixed strndup and getline and some headers so it compiles cleanly
	on bsd (tested on freebsd 3.5).

0.7.4
	Reductions with '-u' run in batch mode.
	Accept decimal and optional eastern longitudes.
	Fast .gcx file search.
	use fractional pixels in central aperture.
	a second step of aperture centering refinement uses pixels inside
	  the measuring aperture that are above sky.
	report star frame positions and centroid errors in phot rep.

0.7.3
	support for DATE_OBS and TIME_OBS fields
	header fields debug prints
	scintillation pars check
	support for IC and sao edb catalogs

0.7.2
	Fixed initialisation of FN_EPOCH, which caused a segfault when
	  loading fits frames that didn't have a EQUINOX keyword.
	Added an option to handle (broken) unsigned fits files.

0.7.1
	Synthetic mode sky estimation;
	Renamed some pars and changed comments;
	Option to list all options' doc in latex format;
	_many_ chapters added to the manual;
	Tycho stars are now field, not cat;

	  designation;
	aperture photometry uses the multiframe routines for zeropoint
	  fitting;
	we try to get an initial wcs from various fits fields (ra, dec,
	  objctra, objctdec, secpix, obejct);
	reading/writing recipy/star files is now done using the stf;
	add a parameter to limit the standard stars used for reduction to
	  a circular region around the frame center;

	Add option to use centering moves for small scope slews.
	Status pop-up window (visible from a distance) when obscript stops.
	Added a telescope pointing dithering option.

0.5.2

	  high rotation angles to converge.
	Added Losmandy mount support, which is now the default.
	  To revert to the old "lx200 classic" mode, comment out
	  the LOSMANDY define in tele.c; the new mode "should" work

	  on obscript gotos.
	Buttons in telescope control to generate sync/additional align commands.
	Added "abort" buttons that stop an ongoing telescope slew.
	Added the display of hour angle and airmass in the obs page of the
	  camera/telescope control dialog.

0.4.6
	Fixed the camera comm bug introduced in 0.4.5.

0.4.5
	Went over the parameter names and changed a few for brevity. Hopefully for the
	  last time, as this means that some old rc files cannot be read anymore.
	Removed all warnings from gsc.
	Added the option to include catalog objects in generated recipies and
	  convert them to standards.
	Fixed some points in ccd_frame.c and photometry.c where older versions of gcc
	  would give an error.
	Changed the example data.

	gcx now stays in a proper source tree, with ./configure and all that. Also
	has some bug fixes. New features:

	* can run photometry recipy files;
	* new observation script commands;
	* can run an obscript directly from the command line
	  (no need to click);
	* path searching for obs and rcp files;
	* a little bit of online help;
	* work on the manual has started.

0.2.1

	This is a major rewrite of the interface to cx, now using gtk+. Also, the
	camera control code has been moved to a separate process (cpxctrl).

	new features include:

	* can read gsc field stars and search edb files for objects;
	* can match gsc start positions to sources in ccd frames to obtain
	  true world coordinates
	* controls lx200 telescopes;
	* can run observations scripts.
