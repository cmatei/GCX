IMPORTANT: this is not the official development tree for GCX, which is
at https://sourceforge.net/projects/gcx/

I'm pushing my modifications in that CVS tree, so better get it from there.

Let me say that again: not the official tree :-) This is here for my
own convenience, as I don't enjoy working with CVS that much.


And now for the regularly scheduled programming.


=====================================
Building and running gcx

To build the program, do a:
  ./configure ; make
Check the INSTALL file for build options. To install, become root, then run:
  make install
You can then run the program:
  gcx

To create an initial configuration file (~/.gcxrc), run the program, then
select File->Edit Options, then Save. Options can be edited from inside the
Edit Options dialog, or directly in .gcxrc.

The manual is distributed as a latex file, and already built into a pdf and
dvi. To rebuild it, cd to docs, then do make/make dvi/make pdf. make pdf requires
pdflatex.

=====================================
Catalogs

The gsc catalog is available for download from
ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/cats/I/220/

The path to gcx should be set in the config file. Make sure all directory and file
names are in lowercase.

gcx can read edb catalogs (fixed objects only). Currently, it looks
for Messier.edb, NGC.edb, UGC.edb, YBS.edb and gcvs.edb.

=====================================
Controlling cameras & telescopes

gcx uses INDI (http://www.indilib.org) for device control (telescope, camera, etc).
